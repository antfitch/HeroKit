  description: "Load a scene. \n\nRestore Original scene: \nIf you have previously
    visited the scene, the state of the hero kit objects in the scene were saved.
    If you don't want this to happen, mark the \"Restore original scene?\" checkbox.
    \n\nDestroy non-persistent clones: \nIf a persistent object exists in the scene
    you are about to visit by default, and you are using that persistent object in
    the current scene, mark the \"Destroy clones of persistent objects\" checkbox.\n\nWarning:
    This action gets a scene by name. If you change the name of a scene, you need
    to return to this action to update it. The action will automatically update it
    when you open the action. \n\nNote: This action adds the scene to your project's
    build settings so you don't have to manually do this yourself. \n\nNote: If you
    no longer want this scene in your game, you must remove it from the build settings
    manually. To do this, \nclick File > Build Settings. Then uncheck the scene in
    the \"Scenes In Build\" list."
