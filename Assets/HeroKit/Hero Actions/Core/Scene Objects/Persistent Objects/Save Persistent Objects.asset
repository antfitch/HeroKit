  title: 
  description: "Saves the current state of persistent hero objects. Persistent hero
    objects are objects that exist in every scene. \n\nNote: Persistent hero objects
    are also saved when you save a scene or a game. This action is useful if you need
    to delete a persistent object because you need to re-open a scene that contains
    the original persistent object. (for example, a start menu). \n\nNote: If you
    are using a persistent object and you re-enter the scene that contains the original
    persistent object, there will be two copies of the persistent objects in all scenes.
    Before you enter the original scene, you need to delete the current persistent
    object. But, if you do this before you enter the original scene, all of your data
    on the persistent object will be lost unless you save it first. Use this action
    to do this. "
