Localizations are saved in CSV files. A CSV file is a spreadsheet. 
You can create spreadsheets in programs like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.

In the first column, enter your keys.
In the second column, enter the localized text.

IMPORTANT: Your special characters will not appear in your game unless
you save your CSV file as CSV UTF-8. By default, Google Sheets does this for you,
but you will need to specifically save your file with this setting in Microsoft Excel.

IMPORANT NOTE ABOUT AUDIO:
Audio must be saved in an Assets/Resources folder. If it isn't, it can't be localized.
