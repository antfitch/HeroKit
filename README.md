## HOW DOES IT WORK? 
Hero objects are the core of HeroKit. A hero object is a blueprint for an item. Each hero object can have states, events, and actions. A hero object can be anything you want it to be. Create one, attach it to a game object, and hit play. It's that easy. 

## MORE INFO 
HeroKit is unique. It is both a game toolkit AND a visual scripting system. You can create most games faster and with more flexibility than you can with those other tools. 

Out of the box, HeroKit is ideal for creating 2D and 3D RPGs, FPS Games, Adventure Games, SIMs, and Visual Novels, but you can extend it to create almost anything. 

If you don’t know how to code, you can drag, drop, and click your awesome game into existence. If you want to learn how to code you can script custom actions.
